## Project Summary
This project is created for [Project 3 of CS50W](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/). Mail is a simple single page email app that allows user to check inbox, sentbox, send, and receive email.

The backend of the project had already been developed by CS50W. What I worked on in this project is the front-end using JavaScript to make the webpage run dynamically in a single page.
